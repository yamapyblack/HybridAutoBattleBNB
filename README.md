## Description

- **Why Blockchain Game?**

Blockchain games allow players to "Play to earn by owning their own assets". Players enjoy playing the game with their own assets to gain new ones.

This concept is similar to the analog Pokémon card game, where players use their favorite cards to battle and earn rare cards as rewards.

Blockchain enables us to own digital assets, as detailed in "[ReadWriteOwn](https://readwriteown.com/)" by Chris Dixon. The fun lies in playing with owned assets and earning new ones.

- **What is the Hybrid Game?**

We have developed onchain games, but they suffer from poor UX and the risk of smart contract hacking (as many DeFi projects have been hacked).

So, we propose a "Hybrid Game" that offers better UX while ensuring asset ownership (self-custody).

In the game, onchain data stores only three states: start, end, and random seed. This architecture is inspired by the Ethereum Layer2 solution "Plasma," and we named it "PlasmaEngine". Plasma writes only the initial and final states to Ethereum L1, with intermediate states handled offchain.

Anyone can validate the end state from the start state and random seed.

- **The Potential of Hybrid Games to Reach Mass Users**

With "PlasmaEngine," developers can create infinitely scalable games. Take AutoChess, for instance: the game is popular and still played on various platforms. Playing such a game with owned assets would offer a more exciting gaming experience.

Hybrid Games can expand the potential of blockchain games, reaching a mass that has yet to experience blockchain gaming.
